## Tetrapods

### Marsupials
Include opossums (play dead), kangaroos, and koalas.  
Embryos develop within a *placenta* in the mother's uterus.  
They are born very early in development, and completes embryonic development while nursing in a maternal pouch called a marsupium. 

### Eutherians - Placental Mammals
- Have a longer period of pregnancy than marsupials.
- Young comlete their embryonic development within a uterus, joined to the mother by the placenta.
- In Australia, convergent evolution has resulted in a diversity of marsupials that resemble the eutherians in other parts of the world.

### Primates
Include lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and apes.
Three main groups:
1. lemurs, lorises, and pottos
2. tarsiers
3. **anthropoids** (monkeys and apes)
Humans are members of the ape group.

### Derived Characteristics of Primates
Most have hands and feet adapted for grasping.
- large brain and short jaws
- forward-looking eyes close together on the face, providing depth perception
- complex social behavior and parental care
- fully **opposable thumb** (in monkeys and apes)

### :x: phylogenetic tree of primates
We will not be tested on this.
- New World - South America
- Old World - Eurasia

Lemurs, and other types of monkeys are tree-top dwellers to avoid predators.  
They use their tail as their fifth limb. 

### Nonhuman Apes
a. gibbon
b. orangutan - more female dominant
c. gorilla - male dominant (commit infanticide)
d. chimpanzees - also more female dominant
e. bonobos

### Humans have a large brain and bipedal locomotion
- *Homo sapiens* is about 200,000 years old (very young considering life has existed on Earth for at least 3.5 billion years).
- **paleoanthropology** - study of human origins
- **hominins** (formerly called hominids) - more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees

### Derived Characteristics of Humans
These characteristics individually are not limited to just humans. 
- upright posture and bipedal locomotion
- larger brains (folds on the cerebral cortex)
- language capabilities and symbolic thought
- manufacture and use of complex tools
- shortened jaw
- shorter digestive tract

## *Hox* genes
### Duplication of *Hox* genes
Plays a major role in embryonic development. Appears to have occurred around the time vertebrates originated. 
- jawed vertebrates have 4 sets
- jawless vertebrates have 2 sets
- invertebrates and amphioxus have only 1

## Subphylum Vertebrata
- *Craniata = Vertebrata*. However, Craniata is a better name because all of the animals in the category have a skull, while not all have a spine.
- *agnatha* - jawless animals
- musculoskeletal system (endoskeleton)

CARTILAGE is made from *chondro*cytes (developed first).  
BONE is made from *osteo*cytes. It may hae evolved first to store minerals, and later adapted for use in the skeleton.

### Developments
- specialized pharynx - added muscles to make it a more powerful water-pumping organ
- conversion of pharyngeal slits to highly vascularized gills
- tripartite brain (fore/mid/hind brain) within protective cranium of bone/cartilage

### Sensory Organs
- complex eyes
- pressure receptors
- taste/smell receptors
- lateral line receptors (water vibrations)
- electroreceptors (electrical currents)

**extant:** still alive today  
**extinct:** no longer alive

### Extant Jawless Fishes
- little more than 100 species (Agnathans; which does not represent a monophyletic group)
- these belong to two classes the Myxini (hagfishes), and

### Agnathan Characteristics
- no jaws
- keratinized plates and teeth for rasping
- vertebrae absent/reduced
- notochord
- dorsal nerve cord and brain

### Hagfishes: Class Myxini
- lots of pores, very slimy
- not parasitic; feed on dead animals by twisting themselves into a knot and using their tongue to rasp off flesh

### Lampreys: Cephalaspidomorphi 
- latch onto prey using their horny teeth, buccal papillae to form a seal, rasping tongue to dig into flesh
- they have no muscles in their pharynx, so they must let things flow in their mouth

### Evolution of Jaws
- made of cartilage derived from the *neural crest*, the same material as the *gill arches* (support the gills)
- Mallatt (1996, 1998) has suggested that jaws were important for gill ventilation, not grasping prey
- first 2 gill arches fused together to attach to the cranium, and developed into jaws (swallow more easily, more oxygen, move faster)

### Extant Fishes
- jawless (lampreys)
- cartilaginous (sharks, rays)
- bony, ray-finned (most bony fishes: trout, perch, etc.)
- bony, lobe-finned (lungishes, coelacanth - living fossils)

### Class Chondrichthyes
#### 2 Subclasses
- elasmobranchii: sharks and rays
- holocephali: chimaeras (rat/ghostfish)
#### Key characteristics
- well-developed jaws
- highly developed sense organs
- powerful swimming
- streamlined shape (fusiform)

### Sharks
- extant sharks include at least 2 lineages or more
- **squaloid:** smaller brained, mostly live in cold, deep water (various dogfish species, megamouth, cookie-cutter)
- **galeoid:** cominant carnivores of shallow, warm parts of the ocean (hammerheads, tiger sharks, threshers, mackeral, whale sharks)
#### Shark Skin :x:
- placoid scales (cartilaginous fishes)
- bony fishes have canoid/cycloic/chenoic
#### Major "Bone" Modification :x:
- rigid vertebral column of clcified cartilage around notochord allows the axial skeleton to swing from side to side
- neural and hemal arches in the vertebral column protect the spinal cord and blood vessels
- additional intercalary plates that provide extra protection to the nerve cord and blood vessels
#### Teeth :x:
- Each tooth can be rapidly replaced as it becomes worn or damaged. They are not embedded in the jaw but arranged on a spiral or whorl shaped cartilaginous band in which replacement teeth are always developing behind the functional tooth. 
- teeth in young sharks may be replaced as of as once every 8 days
- variations in structure: long and pointed for impaling fish, serrated and angled for shearing/tearing flesh, filter-feeder teeth
- **hyostylic jaw** of a shark (upper jaw) is attached flexibly to the chondocranium in both front and back for different jaw opening position
#### Egg Development
- **oviparous** - females laid the fertilized eggs (mermaid's purses) containing a large quantity of yolk to provide the nutrition needed for embryonic development (ca. 30%)
- **ovoviviparous** - eggs hatch and the babies develop inside the female's body but there is no placenta to nourish the pups
- **viviparous** - eggs hatch inside the female's body and the babies are fed by a placenta which transfers nourishment from the mother to the babies

### Skates and Rays
More than half of the elasmobranchs.
- *dorsoventrally* flattened bodies
- greatly englarged *pectoral fins*, which attach to the side of the head
- gill slits placed ventrally and eyes dorsally placed

**Rays:** live bearing (viviparous); greatly reduced/absent dorsal fin  
**Skates:** egg laying (oviparous); "mermaid's purses", prominent dorsal fin

### Subclass Holocephalie: Chimaeras
Small group of about 33 species of deep sea (> 80 m) cartilaginous fishes known commonly as ratfish or ghostfish
- large head often with an elongated snout
- coveer over the gills (operculum) as in bony fishes 
- venomous spine in front of dorsal fin
- lack both spiracle and stomach

### Class Osteichthyes :x: (more for dissection than the quiz)
Vast majority of vertebrates belong to this clade of gnathostomes. These include ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes.
- bony endoskeleton
- most fishes breathe by drawing water over gills protected by an **operculum** (counter-current)
- fishes control their bouyancy with an air sac known as a **swim bladder**

***STUDY THE TREE (agnatha, chondrichthyes, actinopterygians, sarcopterygians)***

### Teleost Characters :x: (only for the practicuum, not quiz)
- homocercal tail
- circular scales without ganoine
- ossified vertebrae
- swim bladder
- skull with complex jaw mobility 

### Anatomy of a trout :x: (only for practicuum)
- kidney is really far up

## Phylum Chordata
### Subphylums
1. Cephalochordata (lancelets)
2. Urochordata (tunicates)
3. Vertebrata (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, etc.)

### Characteristics
1. notochord
2. single, dorsal, tubular nerve cord
3. pharyngeal pouches or slits
4. endostyle
5. postanal tail

### Notochord
Flexible, rodlike structure extending the length of the body, acting as an anchor point for the muscles. 
- bends without shortening (allows *undulation*)
- replaced by the *vertebral column* in jawed vertebrates

Classification -> Taxonomy
#### Humans
- **Kingdom:** Animalia
  - **Phlyum:** Chordata
    - **Subphylum:** Vertebrata
      - **Superclass:** Tetrapod
        - **Class:** Mammalia
          - **Subclass:** Theria (birthing live young)
            - **Infraclass:** Eutheria (np pouch, like kangaroos)
              - **Order:** Primate

### Animals
- multicellular, eukaryotic, diploid (usually)
- meiosis produces gametes (sperm/egg are the only haploid cells)
- heterotrophic by ingestion
- no cell walls

### Basic Structure
- body wall = outer tube (voluntary skeletal muscle)
- gut (GI tract) = inner tube (surrounded by involuntary smooth muscle)
  mouth -> anus
  
### 5 Key Innovations in Animal Evolution
1. tissues: allow for specialized structures and functions (except sponges)
2. symmetry (radial or bilateral)
3. body cavity
4. various patterns of embryonic development
5. segmentation, or repeated body units

### Tissues
zygote -> eight-cell stage -> blastula -> gastrulation -> gastrula
- **ectoderm:** germ layer covering embryo surface

### Body Cavity
- **acoelomate:** no body cavity (flatworm)
- **pseudocoelomate:** fake cavity between digestive tract and muscle layer
- **coelomate:** true body cavity

### Cleavage Development
- **protostome:** spiral and determinate (mouth first - insects)
- **deutorostome:** radial and indeterminate (anus first - Chordata)
