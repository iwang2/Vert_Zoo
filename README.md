## Subphylum Vertebrata
- *Craniata = Vertebrata*. However, Craniata is a better name because all of the animals in the category have a skull, while not all have a spine.
- *agnatha* - jawless animals

### Duplication of *Hox* genes
Plays a major role in embryonic development. Appears to have occurred around the time vertebrates originated. 
- jawed vertebrates have 4 sets
- jawless vertebrates have 2 sets
- invertebrates and amphioxus have only 1
