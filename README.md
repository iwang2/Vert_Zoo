## Subphylum Vertebrata
- *Craniata = Vertebrata*. However, Craniata is a better name because all of the animals in the category have a skull, while not all have a spine.
- *agnatha* - jawless animals

### Duplication of *Hox* genes
Plays a major role in embryonic development. Appears to have occurred around the time vertebrates originated. 
- jawed vertebrates have 4 sets
- jawless vertebrates have 2 sets
- invertebrates and amphioxus have only 1

- prevents loss of function
- more combinations; more diverse morphology

**extant:** still alive today  
**extinct:** no longer alive

### Extant Jawless Fishes
- little more than 100 species (Agnathans; which does not represent a monophyletic group)
- these belong to two classes the Myxini (hagfishes), and

### Agnathan Characteristics
- no jaws
- keratinized plates and teeth for rasping
- vertebrae absent/reduced
- notochord
- dorsal nerve cord and brain

### Hagfishes: Class Myxini
- lots of pores, very slimy
- not parasitic; feed on dead animals by twisting themselves into a knot and using their tongue to rasp off flesh

### Lampreys: Cephalaspidomorphi 
- latch onto prey using their horny teeth, buccal papillae to form a seal, rasping tongue to dig into flesh
- they have no muscles in their pharynx, so they must let things flow in their mouth

### Evolution of Jaws
- made of cartilage derived from the *neural crest*, the same material as the *gill arches* (support the gills)
- Mallatt (1996, 1998) has suggested that jaws were important for gill ventilation, not grasping prey
- first 2 gill arches fused together to attach to the cranium, and developed into jaws (swallow more easily, more oxygen, move faster)

### Extant Fishes
- jawless (lampreys)
- cartilaginous (sharks, rays)
- bony, ray-finned (most bony fishes: trout, perch, etc.)
- bony, lobe-finned (lungishes, coelacanth - living fossils)

### Class Chondrichthyes
#### 2 Subclasses
- elasmobranchii: sharks and rays
- holocephali: chimaeras (rat/ghostfish)
#### Key characteristics
- well-developed jaws
- highly developed sense organs
- powerful swimming
- streamlined shape (fusiform)

### Sharks
- extant sharks include at least 2 lineages or more
- **squaloid:** smaller brained, mostly live in cold, deep water (various dogfish species, megamouth, cookie-cutter)
- **galeoid:** cominant carnivores of shallow, warm parts of the ocean (hammerheads, tiger sharks, threshers, mackeral, whale sharks)
#### Shark Skin :x:
- placoid scales (cartilaginous fishes)
- bony fishes have canoid/cycloic/chenoic
#### Major "Bone" Modification :x:
- rigid vertebral column of clcified cartilage around notochord allows the axial skeleton to swing from side to side
- neural and hemal arches in the vertebral column protect the spinal cord and blood vessels
- additional intercalary plates that provide extra protection to the nerve cord and blood vessels
#### Teeth :x:
- Each tooth can be rapidly replaced as it becomes worn or damaged. They are not embedded in the jaw but arranged on a spiral or whorl shaped cartilaginous band in which replacement teeth are always developing behind the functional tooth. 
- teeth in young sharks may be replaced as of as once every 8 days
- variations in structure: long and pointed for impaling fish, serrated and angled for shearing/tearing flesh, filter-feeder teeth
- **hyostylic jaw** of a shark (upper jaw) is attached flexibly to the chondocranium in both front and back for different jaw opening position
#### Egg Development
- **oviparous** - females laid the fertilized eggs (mermaid's purses) containing a large quantity of yolk to provide the nutrition needed for embryonic development (ca. 30%)
- **ovoviviparous** - eggs hatch and the babies develop inside the female's body but there is no placenta to nourish the pups
- **viviparous** - eggs hatch inside the female's body and the babies are fed by a placenta which transfers nourishment from the mother to the babies

### Skates and Rays
More than half of the elasmobranchs.
- *dorsoventrally* flattened bodies
- greatly englarged *pectoral fins*, which attach to the side of the head
- gill slits placed ventrally and eyes dorsally placed

**Rays:** live bearing (viviparous); greatly reduced/absent dorsal fin  
**Skates:**

### Subclass Holocephalie: Chimaeras
Small group of about 33 species of deep sea (> 80 m) cartilaginous fishes known commonly as ratfish or ghostfish
- large head often with an elongated snout
- coveer over the gills (operculum) as in bony fishes 
- venomous spine in front of dorsal fin
- lack both spiracle and stomach
